810: 
811:You are already a member of another group.
812:Don't waste my time.
813: 
814:You are still an amateur....
815:return to me when you are Level 30.
816: 
817:You are not an Archer.
818:Go bother someone else...
819: 
820:So` you want to become a [Sniper] and join the [Free Cats]?
821:Looks like you need a better weapon.
822:What do you mean?	Cancel Job transfer.
823:You cannot do much with the [Bow] you have.
824:What do I need to do now to become a [Sniper]?	Cancel Job transfer.
825:(Takes a piece of paper and writes a note.)
826:Give this memo to [Detruit Boldger] in [Haku village].
827:[Detruit Boldger] often travels between [Millena Town] and [Haku village] to sell weapons...
828:He will probably ask you to get him some materials to make you a better [Bow].
829:Once he gives you the new [Bow]` bring that back to me.
830: 
831:After you get the [Bow] from [Detruit Boldger]` Come back to me.
832: 
833:So you managed to get [Detruit Boldger] to make you a new [Bow].
834:I am impressed!
835:A [Sniper] plays an important role in the battlefield....
836:..and provide crucial offensive and defensive support to the soldiers in the frontline.
837:Do you think you have what it takes to be a [Sniper]?
838:You have to be able to think and move quickly.
839:Of Course!	I do not think so...
840:Go to [Plains of Memory] and follow the road to [Tough Wind Deserted Area].
841:Find and defeat [Kayron Magician].
842:Remember' you have to do this alone' and bring me a piece of evidence to prove you have defeated [Kayron Magician].
843:If you return to me with the evidence` you will be accepted as a member of the [Free Cats].
844:But I will keep this [Bow] for you until you return.
845: 
846:Have you not succeeded in defeating [Kayron Magician]?
847: 
848:Well then probably you are not ready to join [Free Cats].
849: 
850:(Looking at the [Kayron Horn])
851:(winking) Great work!!!
852:I am convinced that you are fit to be a member of the [Free Cats].
853:You are now officially a member of the [Free Cats].
854:And here's the [Bow] that you brought from [Detruit Boldger].
855:You can return to me to learn more skills...
856: 
857:Which skill would you like to learn?
858:Bye.
859:Now that you have a [Staff]` you will have to prove your ability if you want to become a [Holy Avenger].
860:A [Holy Avenger] uses [Proima] just like a [Priest]...
861:but instead of using [Proima] for healing....
862:[Holy Avengers] use it to protect and strengthen others as well as a destructive tool to defeat their foes.
863:We have to have strong instincts....do you have that?
864:Yes! I have that!	Okay..I think I don't want to be a [Holy Avenger] anymore..
865:Go to [Esan Snow Area] near [Jede Village] and defeat [Male Picos] with the help of a party.
866:You have to complete this task with a party.
867:Bring me proof of your deed and only then will I accept you as a member of [Bengens].
868:I will keep this [Staff] with me until you return.
869: 
870:Go to [Esan Snow Area] and defeat [Male Picos] with the help of a party.
871:Return to me with proof of your deed and you will officially be part of us [Bengens].
872: 
873:(Carefully checking the [Pico Tail]) Good!
874:You have proven that you are worthy to become part of [Bengens].
875:With the authority given by the people of Rain you are now a [Holy Avenger] and a proud member of [Bengens].
876:This [Staff] is now yours..
877:From now on you cannot use [Magical Script] and any other weapon... ...
878:If you would like know more skills of a [Holy Avenger]` come talk to me again.
879: 
880:What do you need from me?
881:I want to become a member of [Bengens]!	Good bye.
882:You already belong to another organization.
883: 
884:You have yet to master the use of [Proima].
885:Talk to me again when you reach level 30.
886: 
887:We don't accept [Shamans]...
888:[Ka Lubleton] may be able to help you instead.
889: 
890:So you want to become a [Holy Avenger]?
891:A [Holy Avenger] wields a [Staff] and uses [Proima] to protect and strengthen others.
892:But` by becoming a [Holy Avenger]` you will lose all of your previous [Magician] skills.
893:Do not worry though` you will get all of your used skill points back.
894:Do you still want to become a [Holy Avenger]?
895:Yes!	I may need more time to think about it.
896:Well` if you insist ... 
897:First` you need a [Staff] to release the power of [Proima]. 
898:A [Staff]?	I think I've changed my mind...
899:(Hands over a neatly folded piece of paper.)
900:Bring this memo to [Luel] in [Jede Village].
901:She often goes to [Jede Village] to sell weapons to buyers...
902:If you fulfill her conditions` she can create a [Staff] for you.
903:Return to me once you have the [Staff] in your possession.
904: 
905:Go to [Jede Village] and talk to [Luel] to get a [Staff].
906:Return to me once you have the [Staff] in your possession.
907: 
908:Which skill do you want to learn?
909:Leave.
910:You are the bravest of the brave.. Here is my reward to you.
911: 
912:Thank you.
913: 
914:You will be the future of Rain if you continue heroic deeds such as this.
915: 
916:(Hmmm....) 
917:(Before you can become a [Psyche]` you will have to go through a ritual...)
918:(...that will detach your mind and soul from your physical body...)
919:(This ritual will require some feathers from the creature [Pico]..)
920:Go on..
921:(You can find plenty of [Picos] at [Esan Snow Area] ...)
922:(We need 5 [Pico Feathers] to commence the ritual.)

927:(Return to me once you have found 5 [Pico Feathers]...)
928: 
929:((Staring at the 5 feathers) We are ready now.)
930:(Just a moment... ... ..
931:(She burns the feathers.)
932:(Throws the ash in the air) In the name of [Proima Tesarat] from the [Great Dimension]' this small body will own two characteristics.
933:Relax...and calm yourself...
934:Your mind will now enter another plane consolidate your will and [Proima] will guide you to your destiny.
935:[Erekte Secrate Flamine Tesarate].
936:Ptttuii. (spit).
937:(There's light around me ... ...)
938:(You have now become a member of [Arkanas]...)
939:(Now you can learn [Multiple Characteristic (Arack)].)
940:([Arck] will improve your fighting ability ...)
941:(...and if you wish to learn another skill` come back to me.")
942: 
943:(Wow..She looks scary..)
944:Who are you calling 'scary'?!! ....
945:Cool..you can read my mind! I want to be a member of [Arkanas]!	!!!.. Stop reading my mind! Goodbye!
946:You already belong to another organization.
947: 
948:You are still not good enough to be a [Psyche]. Talk to me again when you are stronger.
949: 
950:(You are not a [Shaman]... Don't waste my time..)
951: 
952:(So you want to become a [Psyche] huh?...)
953:Of course!	Uhm..Maybe this is not such a good idea..
954:( ... ... ... )

967: 
968:Isn't it a nice day today?
969: 
970:Have a pleasant day ahead.

985:Ah` but you are an [Archer].

987: 
988:To be a member of [Twinible Balkan]` you must be able to use a [Big Sword].
989:Maybe you should talk to either [Kurio Khan] or [Reishana Cube].
990:I'm sure they will be able to help someone like you.
991: 
992:Oh`... you must be the one [Supreme Heart] was talking about.
993:So you have decided to become a [Slayer]?
994:[Supreme Heart] told you about me?	No. I don't think I want to be a [Slayer].
995:Haha.. Small world isn't it?

1015:Now for the next test....[Trial of the sword and madness]....
1016:A [Slayer] is crucial in deciding the outcome of a battle.
1017:Because we can dish out a huge amount of damage' we usually end up being the main damage dealers in parties.
1018:[Slayers] are known to have this thing called [Madness] coursing through our veins and burning in our spirit!
1019:Do you have the [Madness] in you?!!

1081:You think you have what it takes to become a [Knight]?
1082:Of course!	[Shield]? [Heavy Armor]? Sorry` I don't think I want to be a [Knight].
1083:The power of a [Knight] lies in his [Shield] and his belief in his own strength.
1084:First` bring me a [Shield].
1085:What?! From where?.	Sorry` I don't think I want to be a [Knight].
1086:(Hands over a neatly folded piece of paper.)

1596:This is important as you will need this to be able to use your higher skills.
1597:In order to fill up your [Proima Gauge]' you will need to successfully complete your combo attacks.

1777:Although....hmm..I may need some help with something...
1778:..but..come back and talk to me when I'm in a better mood.
1779:In the meantime` continue your studies of the Proima and return to me when you are stronger
1780: 
1781:You are much better than I expected.
1782:But did not you feel drawn more to magic than the sword?
1783:Of course` I had no choice....
1784:It is probable that there is more to his story...
1785: 
1786:I have always pictured the world as a beautiful place without any problems...
1787:Silly beginners are going in and out through the portals every day..
1788:They make this place look terrible with their fighting and they are always so noisy...
1789:They look like fools` always trying to communicate with Proima and trying to master things they do not fully understand...
1790:Hmmm.. But I feel there is something different about you....Hmmmm.....##( He seems to be thinking about something...)
1791:Do you think you are strong enough to handle a little problem of mine?
1792:Of course! What is it?	Erm..Sorry` I'm busy .(...strange man.)
1793:Hmm... There is a group of Marons...
1794:...who annoyed and disturbed me when I was reading a book...
1795:They suddenly attacked me and caught me off guard!!!
1796:I could have defeated them with a single blow' but I can't stand their smell..especially not when they are together!!
1797:Because of that` I had to get away from them and in so doing` I forgot all about my book.
1798:I went back to my reading spot after they left but couldn't find my book...
1799:Those Maron rascals must have taken it...
1800:So can you help me retrieve my book back from Chief Maron?

1805: 
1806:Bah! You are also like the others!!!

1808: 
1809:What is taking you so long to get my book back from Chief Maron?

1819: 
1820:Long time no see.. It seems like you have wasted alot of energy the last time...
1821:...and so your ability to use Proima magic now is very low.
1822:That is why to get your strength and energy back to normal` you must have great mental power which is beyond your current ability.
1823:I have a secret book which tells about Proima....
1824:..but I cannot read it as it is written in an ancient language. I heard that Onylis is the only one who can translate it.
1825:Can you meet Onylis and translate this book?
1826:Yes.	No.
1827:Thank you so much...this does seem to be the Secret Book of Proima.
1828:Now` I will teach you [Meditation Lvl 3].

1830: 
1831:The book is not translated yet. Please take it to Onylis in [Rain Town] to have it translated.
1832:Alright` if you translate the book for me` I will share with you the secrets of its content.
1833: 
1834:Are you satisfied with your mental power now?
1835:Visit Luimi and bring me a sample of Clean Water of Flame and I will tell you how to get more out of your mental power.

1838:You have yet to bring me the Clean Water of Flame.

1840: 
1841:Where is the Clean Water of Flame?
1842: 
1843:That's the right attitude. Since you are from Rain` you must learn to utilize all of your mental power.
1844: 
1845:I have a plan to turn all of Millena to ruins.
1846:Please deliver this plan to Saiki Rugart and bring the confirmation to Ka Lubleton! Hurry up!
1847: 
1848:Finally! I can't wait to attack Millena!	No. I don't believe in this senseless war business.

1850: 
1851:Bring the plan to both of them!!! At this rate` we will miss a good opportunity!

2331: 
2332:The funeral expense is 10000 Elds.
2333: 
2334:Are you mad?! Your pet is still alive!!
2335: 
2336:The funeral expense 10000 Elds.
2337: 
2338:Are you mad?! Your pet is still alive!!
2339: 
2340:Ok` What do you want to know?
2341:What is a pet?	How do I summon a pet?	About Pet Health Point (HP)?	Oh` I don't need to know anything else.
2342:I catch wild monsters and tame them so that they are domesticated and can help us humans with many things.
2343:If a pet is fed constantly` it will grow better. Do you know that you can raise 3 pets concurrently?
2344:There are generally 2 types of pets. The first type will attack enemies and the other type will protect you againt enemy attacks.
2345:A pet will be summoned when you call for it. Its ability will increase according to its level.
2346:I have more questions.	Ok` I think that's all I need to know.
2347:A pet's health gets weaker and weaker all the time` even when you are asleep and not playing. (in real time not in game time).
2348:So be careful if you plan to travel for a long time and will be away from the world of DECO Online.
2349:A pet learns to eat its food directly from the pet inventory. So` remember to stock up food in your pet inventory every now and then.
2350:A pet with very low Health Points (HP) can lead to a disastrous end for the pet...
2351:...as if your pet dies` you have to arrange a funeral for it with my help.
2352:I have more questions.	I think I have learnt enough.
2353:Your pet grows each time you summon it. However` I have heard that there is a special item that can help your pet to grow faster.
2354:When your pet has been actively summoned` it will help you to attack the enemy or protect you using its CP (Concentrating Point).
2355:If your pet runs out of CP` it cannot help you so you need to give your pet a rest.
2356:I have more questions.	That's all I need to know.
2357:Hello.
